## Open-Source, not Open-Contribution
WeLearn project is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and can do what you like with it in the limites set by the license. But WeLearn project is not open-contribution.
We are a small team, and we don't have the resources to manage contributions. We are not able to review and merge pull requests.

If you see a bug (not security related), or have a suggestion, please open an issue. We will try to address it as soon as possible. 
**If the bug is critical or data security related, please contact us directly at [welearn@learningplanetinstitute.org](mailto:welearn@learningplanetinstitute.org) and follow the instructions in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file.**
