      "description": "On April 8, 2024, the moon’s shadow will race from Mexico to Canada — and Texas to Maine across the United States — in what some consider to be the most awe-inspiring spectacle in all of nature: a total solar eclipse. Umbraphile David Baron chases these rare events across the globe, and in this ode to the bliss of seeing the solar corona, he explains why you owe it to yourself to witness one, too.",
